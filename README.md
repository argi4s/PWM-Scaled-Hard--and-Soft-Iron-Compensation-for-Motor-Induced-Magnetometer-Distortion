# PWM-Scaled-Hard--and-Soft-Iron-Compensation-for-Motor-Induced-Magnetometer-Distortion
This is the Group Project of the Robotics Systems module, where we had to come up with an experiment of our choice and write a report about the results of it.

This Repository contains only the report of the project. In short, we tried to show that the Polulu 3Pi+ 32U4 robot has a magnetometer that is affected by the electromagnetic field produced by the current that flows through the robots circuits. It is proved, that as the PWM wheel value increases, so does the distortion in the magnetometer readings.
